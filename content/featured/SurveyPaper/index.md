My ethusiasm for Cloud Computing has it's roots in my ardent passion for Operating Systems, Storage and Network Security. This survey paper explores every layer of Cloud from Virtual Machines to the web portals. The paper focuses on the vulnerabilities that have been discovered by OWASP over the last few years specifically in the area of Cloud Computing. It concludes with multifaceted resolutions at a technical and business level as well as brings promising ongoing reserach to the reader.
