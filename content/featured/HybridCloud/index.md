A scalable, efficient Image recognition application, using a deep learning model on a hybrid cloud, employing both resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and OpenStack. This image classification application is designed to be elastic, concurrent, fast, and cache-efficient. It can scale up and down according to traffic, handle multiple requests simultaneously, offer quick response time, and store every request image and classification result in a cache, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced load on the application.
